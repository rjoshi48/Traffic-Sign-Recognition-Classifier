# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Classifier
## Problem Description:
Traffic signs are important part of road infrastructure as they help the drivers to follow traffic rules and reduce the number of accidents on road. They give drivers crucial information and, at times, persuading advice that require them to change how they drive in order to comply with the rules of the road as they are being enforced. Without these helpful signs, there would likely be more accidents since drivers would not receive feedback on how fast they could safely drive or be alerted to impending roadwork, abrupt turns, or school crossings.

The classification and detection of traffic signs is crucial for driver-assistance systems, highway maintenance and especially for the development of autonomous vehicle technology. This assignment involves working on a self-driving car perception problem known as traffic signalization detection. To solve this problem deep learning is used, resulting in the development of a model that accurately categorises traffic signs and learns to choose the best characteristics for the task on its own.
